                                                    <p>In an age where very few artists break the mold and truly shine through as
                                                        unique and innovative, Dutch star Ummet Ozcan is one of the exceptions to
                                                        the rule. Not only because of his advanced studio knowledge and the
                                                        impressive string of dance floor hits this resulted in, it’s also thanks to

                                                        of dance music, The Netherlands, it isn’t difficult for Ozcan to plunge into
                                                        dance music at an early age. “The EDM scene has been very big here since I
                                                        was a teenager. We’ve had dance music playing on radio stations for over 20
                                                        years now”, he explains. So, as soon as he’s good and ready, music starts to
                                                        come out of Ozcan’s studio. It won’t take long before he gets the attention
                                                        he deserves. Since achieving his first major success in 2011 with ‘Reboot’,

                                                    <p>Leprous is a progressive metal band from Notodden, Norway, formed in 2001.
                                                        Leprous&#39; style is typically classified as progressive metal or
                                                        progressive rock and it singled out for its progressive elements, peculiar
                                                        harmonies, singing style, and blending of different genres. Their sound has
                                                        also been categorized as experimental rock, avant-garde metal, and pop.
                                                        However, the band&#39;s members do not affiliate themselves with a specific
                                                        genre. Einar Solberg, one of the band’s founding members, claims inspiration
                                                        from Radiohead, Massive Attack, Arvo Pärt, Susanne Sundfør, Behemoth, and
                                                        The Prodigy in addition to more analogous progressive bands such as
                                                        Porcupine Tree and The Dillinger Escape Plan. In a time where progressive
                                                        music is emerging and there are so many options available to new listeners,
                                                        it takes serious guts and personality to turn heads anymore. Norway’s
                                                        Leprous has done just that in recent years, and it has been such a joy to
                                                        watch them emerge into the limelight of awareness within the progressive
                                                        community. It is no wonder, however, as Leprous continues to mature and to
                                                        cling ever closer to their hearts when crafting new music. Leprous is a
                                                        visionary band that defies genre labelling, not just in the style, but also
                                                        in their attitude. Leprous, however, is not a band that takes success
                                                        resting on their hind quarters, as they believe in pushing boundaries,
                                                        learning from their mistakes, and following their instincts. This was proved
                                                        when they released their new album “Malina” this summer, and offered a left

                                                        <p>Leprous is a progressive metal band from Notodden, Norway, formed in 2001.
                                                            Leprous&#39; style is typically classified as progressive metal or
                                                            progressive rock and it singled out for its progressive elements, peculiar
                                                            harmonies, singing style, and blending of different genres. Their sound has
                                                            also been categorized as experimental rock, avant-garde metal, and pop.
                                                            However, the band&#39;s members do not affiliate themselves with a specific
                                                            genre. Einar Solberg, one of the band’s founding members, claims inspiration
                                                            from Radiohead, Massive Attack, Arvo Pärt, Susanne Sundfør, Behemoth, and
                                                            The Prodigy in addition to more analogous progressive bands such as
                                                            Porcupine Tree and The Dillinger Escape Plan. In a time where progressive
                                                            music is emerging and there are so many options available to new listeners,
                                                            it takes serious guts and personality to turn heads anymore. Norway’s
                                                            Leprous has done just that in recent years, and it has been such a joy to
                                                            watch them emerge into the limelight of awareness within the progressive
                                                            community. It is no wonder, however, as Leprous continues to mature and to
                                                            cling ever closer to their hearts when crafting new music. Leprous is a
                                                            visionary band that defies genre labelling, not just in the style, but also
                                                            in their attitude. Leprous, however, is not a band that takes success
                                                            resting on their hind quarters, as they believe in pushing boundaries,
                                                            learning from their mistakes, and following their instincts. This was proved
                                                            when they released their new album “Malina” this summer, and offered a left

                                            (that help him to write). A hardcore cat lover added to his charmingly shy

                                            both interesting and amusing, to say the least. Thanks to his quick tongue
                                            (he thinks faster than he can speak), many have suggested that he should cut
                                            a rap record, but his shy demeanour keeps him from it. The
                                            ‘say-it-like-it-is’ comedian started performing in 2013 and recently came

                                            unique and innovative, Dutch star Ummet Ozcan is one of the exceptions to
                                            the rule. Not only because of his advanced studio knowledge and the
                                            impressive string of dance floor hits this resulted in, it’s also thanks to
                                            his enduring presence at worldwide mainstages these last years. A success
                                            story that’s about to enter new grounds. Growing up in the known epicentre
                                            of dance music, The Netherlands, it isn’t difficult for Ozcan to plunge into
                                            dance music at an early age. “The EDM scene has been very big here since I
                                            was a teenager. We’ve had dance music playing on radio stations for over 20
                                            years now”, he explains. So, as soon as he’s good and ready, music starts to
                                            come out of Ozcan’s studio. It won’t take long before he gets the attention
                                            he deserves. Since achieving his first major success in 2011 with ‘Reboot’,
                                            which spends seven weeks at #1 on Beatport, the veteran DJ’s major hits have
                                            been sampled in his peers’ radio podcasts and played at festival mainstages
                                            all over the world. Catch him playing live on 27th December at Gymkhana

                                        <p>Leprous is a progressive metal band from Notodden, Norway, formed in 2001.
                                            Leprous&#39; style is typically classified as progressive metal or
                                            progressive rock and it singled out for its progressive elements, peculiar
                                            harmonies, singing style, and blending of different genres. Their sound has
                                            also been categorized as experimental rock, avant-garde metal, and pop.
                                            However, the band&#39;s members do not affiliate themselves with a specific
                                            genre. Einar Solberg, one of the band’s founding members, claims inspiration
                                            from Radiohead, Massive Attack, Arvo Pärt, Susanne Sundfør, Behemoth, and
                                            The Prodigy in addition to more analogous progressive bands such as
                                            Porcupine Tree and The Dillinger Escape Plan. In a time where progressive
                                            music is emerging and there are so many options available to new listeners,
                                            it takes serious guts and personality to turn heads anymore. Norway’s
                                            Leprous has done just that in recent years, and it has been such a joy to
                                            watch them emerge into the limelight of awareness within the progressive
                                            community. It is no wonder, however, as Leprous continues to mature and to
                                            cling ever closer to their hearts when crafting new music. Leprous is a
                                            visionary band that defies genre labelling, not just in the style, but also
                                            in their attitude. Leprous, however, is not a band that takes success
                                            resting on their hind quarters, as they believe in pushing boundaries,
                                            learning from their mistakes, and following their instincts. This was proved
                                            when they released their new album “Malina” this summer, and offered a left
                                            hook to the progressive world.</p>
